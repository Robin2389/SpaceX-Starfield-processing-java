# Creating a SpaceX loading screen Starfield in Java

This program is a version of the tutorial from the Code Train team on Youtube. This program gives a basic understanding of java concepts for graphic design development. 

To run this program, I recommend downloading the Processing software from processing.org. They have a lot of wonderful information about learning java and practising with java. There are also tutorials on youtube of how to download and set up the program.

Once you have copied this code into your processing program and saved it, you will have to then download images in order to have a background image, and the spacex logo working in your program. You will have to download a jpg of a star field off the internet and a pnr image of the space x logo. ('.jpg' is a common file extension for photos, and '.pnr' is a common file extension for photos that don't have a background). The use of the photos in the program can only if after you have downloaded them, you import them into your program by:
  clicking the 'sketch' tab of the processing window -> 'add file' -> and then choosing the actual jpg and pnr image from your downloads folder or wherever you saved it. (make sure the names in the program match your to the actual name of the file you saved)
