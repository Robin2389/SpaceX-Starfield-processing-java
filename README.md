# Creating a SpaceX loading screen Starfield in Java

This program is a version of the tutorial from the Code Train team on Youtube. This program gives a basic understanding of java concepts for graphic design development. 

To run this program, I recommend downloading the Processing software from processing.org.

In order to have a background image, you will have to download a jpg off the internet and make sure to include it in your program by:
  clicking the sketch tab -> add file -> and then choosing the actual jpg image from your downloads folder or wherever you saved it.
